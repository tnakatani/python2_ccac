# Peer tutorial

## Peer Tutorial Specs
1. Objective - Provide us pythons with 15-20 minute "crash courses" on topics that may not be worthy of an entire evening in python II
2. Quick Reference - Read the book and python.org documentation on your subject. Run some code. Distill down the example code provided in the references to the essential module and topics only. Also, boil down the reference content to diagrams, figures, or bulleted lists of core ideas or topics.  Assemble a 1/2 page (with the page in landscape orientation) quick reference for your topic that neatly arranges this information
3. Prepare a sample activity -
4. Purpose Extension - Drawing from examples of others, create a 10-15 minute coding exercise that you write entirely on your own using some sort of consolidating topic of your choosing (i.e. Eric using airline safety and metallurgy to discuss statistics). The example should include essential functionality of your topic and should be expandable.
5. Create a short list of continuation exercises for somebody to guide their further explorations into your topic. Document these extensions either in a text file on GitHub or in comments in your sample code.
