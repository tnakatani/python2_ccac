# APIs

## API fundamentals

IP address is an address of a host

### IP octets: 

```
# Example IP address
104 236 104 185 : 443
```
- Routing algorithms systematically forwards IP number to other routers.
- Can use tools like [traceroute-online.com](https://traceroute-online.com/) or ```traceroute``` in your terminal to trace the routing of requests

## NHTSA.gov API

NHTSA provides an API for complaints, recalls, safety ratings, etc.  You can directly query their database by requesting a URL that follows their format.

Example: Request recall info for Saturn LS 2000 models
```
curl https://webapi.nhtsa.gov/api/Recalls/vehicle/modelyear/2000/make/saturn/model/LS?format=json
```

The above request will return the following (with some extra formatting)

```json
