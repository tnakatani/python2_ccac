# API Design Project

## Program Objective

Use data from an API service to answer one or more compelling inquiry questions of your design

## Program Requirement 1

Engineer a python script that uses the requests library to make calls to an API of your choosing. Assemble data that is returned from that API to answer the question or set of questions you designed for this project.

## Program Requirement 2

Once you have data assembled that speaks to your research question, format the results of your API inquiry in a format that is understandable by a non-pythonista and can be posted on our course website and on the walls of our classroom 1136! Graphs, charts, figures, tables, images--all of these are welcome and invited.
