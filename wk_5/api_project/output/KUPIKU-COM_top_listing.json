To get our shipping rates, simply take a look below the price of the item in our store.  If you are logged into your Discogs account, and have a shipping address saved, you will see the shipping cost displayed. \r\n\r\nWe offer three services (via Japan Post):  \r\n\r\nAir Mail (generally takes around 2-3 weeks to reach most parts of the world, tracking/insurance is not available).\r\nRegistered Air Mail (2-3 weeks on average, comes with online tracking, and insurance). \r\nEMS (Japan's elite shipping ninjas deliver these quite swiftly (sometimes in just a few days to most countries ). However, ultimately delivery time always depends on how efficient customs clearance and the domestic postal service in your country operates, once EMS Japan hands the package over to them.  There are times (albeit rare) where even EMS can take several weeks to arrive.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:  Our shipping department will be closed for the Christmas Holidays and the first week of the New Year.  Our shipping will resume on January 8, although - please note, that due to the backup in orders amassed during this period, we may not be able to immediately provide tracking or shipping on our first day back.  Please bare with us, and allow us some leniency during this holiday season.  \r\n\r\nOur customer service team will be available to assist you on a daily basis throughout the holidays, nevertheless.  Any questions about items will be answered in their usual prompt manner.  Details about shipping or shipment status however, may not be available until after the Christmas/New Year's holiday.  \r\n\r\nThank you for your understanding - and we wish all of our friends here a most wonderful and safe Holiday Season and New Year celebrations!\r\n\r\n-Mayumi, Haruka, PJ, and the rest of the Kupiku.com team\r\n\r\n\r\nCDs:\r\n\r\n*ITALIAN CUSTOMERS:  Due to the poor performance of Italian Post, we now only offer EMS service to Italy.  We apologize for this, but - even on Japan Post website, there is a warning about Italian Post and the risk of sending to Italy.  Too many packages are lost, delayed for many months, held by Italian Customs for long periods of time, or face other problems when sending to Italy.  For this reason, we now will only offer EMS service to Italy (21.75 CHF for one CD/DVD, or 29.75 for one vinyl record).  However, to help with this cost, we will offer FREE shipping to Italian customers, for any extra item in the same order:  so, no matter if you buy 1 CD, or 10 CDs, your shipping cost is still just 21.75 CHF, for quick, registered, insured EMS service).  Please also note, by law, we must include the correct invoice inside the package:  we cannot declare an incorrect value on the package for you).  \r\n\r\n\r\nWORLDWIDE SHIPPING: \r\n\r\nZone 1: \r\n\r\nAustria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, Vatican City State, Andorra, Spain (Canary Islands), United Kingdom, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,Ireland,Latvia,Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden,  Australia, New Zealand, United States, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan\r\n\r\nAir Mail/Economy mail: CHF 6.00 + CHF 1.00 for each addition item (up to a maximum order value of 75 CHF)\r\nRegistered mail CHF 14.25 + CHF 2.00 for each addition item \r\nEMS CHF 21.75 + CHF 3.00 for each addition item \r\n\r\nVinyl, Laserdisc:\r\nAir Mail : CHF 14.10\r\nRegistered mail at CHF 24.25 \r\nEMS service at CHF 33.75 \r\n\r\nZone 2:\r\n\r\nFrance, Romania, Cyprus, Russian Federation, France (European Territory), Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gibraltar, Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Belarus, Moldavia, Ukraine\r\n\r\nRegistered mail CHF 9.25 + CHF 4.00 for each addition item \r\nEMS CHF 21.75 + CHF 3.00 for each addition item \r\n* Air Mail is not available for country listed above. \r\n\r\nZone 3: \r\n\r\nIndonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, United Arab Emirates, Georgia, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Mongolia\r\n\r\nRegistered mail CHF 14.25 + CHF 3.00 for each addition item \r\nEMS CHF 21.75 + CHF 3.00 for each addition item \r\n\r\n* Air Mail or other services are not offered for countries listed above due to the high risk associated with sending mail to these countries (based on many years of our experience).
