# Allegheny County Health Violation Analysis

## Program Objective

Write a script that answers basic data-based questions concerning health violations in Allgheny county

## Questions to Pursue in Allegheny County Health Code Violations

1. What types of health violations are most common in three municipal areas of your choosing?
2. Which types of violations are mostly only considered "high" severity and not "medium" or "low" severity?
3. Which classification of restaurant (i.e. use the column 'description') has the most "high" severity violations? Does this vary by the municipalities of your choosing?

## Choose Your Own Dataset

1. Choose a dataset of your own or one listed on the [Western PA Regional Data Center](https://data.wprdc.org/). It will be easiest to choose a dataset published as CSV file type for ingestion by pandas.

2. Write a script that uses pandas to describe the value counts of each key variable.

3. Then slice your dataset using a value in a column of your choosing and compare a pattern of your choosing between your sliced sub-data-sets.
