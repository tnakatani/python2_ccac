"""
Create a program in python that uses looping and basic data structures to display customized 10x10 student icons in various scales and orientations.

Create a data structure (list, tuple, dictionary) that can represent the sequence of on and off cells in each icon inside your python program

Read your custom data structure to display a visual representation of your icon using a single symbol, such as an asterisk or an at-sign.

Implement one or more transformations on a given icon, starting with scaling, such that each "cell" is represnted by not just one character, but a square of characters of a given size. Consider other transformations such as inverting on and off cells, or rotating by a specified amount of degrees

Review your code and break it up into as many sensible functions as possible, allowing for code re-use. Comment each function such that its purpose is clear to other users.

Post your code on your github account
